		<p>
			With over a decade of experience in cybersecurity and IT infrastructure, I bring military precision and enterprise-grade security expertise to businesses of all sizes. As the founder of Morris IT Consulting, I leverage my background as a United States Air Force veteran and senior security engineer to deliver robust, compliant, and innovative technology solutions.

		<h3>Military-Grade Security Experience</h3>
		<p>

		<h3>Enterprise Security Leadership</h3>

My experience spans the entire security lifecycle - from threat detection and incident response to security architecture and risk management.
